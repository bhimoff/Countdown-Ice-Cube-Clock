# Countdown firmware for Adafruit's Ice Cube Clock #
This is firmware based on Ladyada's clock with some community additions, as well
as modifications to allow it to count down to a preset date and time.  Over 100 days
it counts down as dddd.hh.mm and under 100 days if counts dd.hh.mm.ss.  This is great
for teams to keep up with a project deadline that will not move.
